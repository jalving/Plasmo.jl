# Plasmo.jl
Plasmo.jl (which stands for Platform for Scalable Modeling and Optimization) is a graph-based algebraic modeling framework.  It adopts a modular style to
create optimization problems and facilitates the management of distributed and hierarchical structures.  Plasmo.jl has been developed with the key notion that it aligns with the
behavior of JuMP as much as possible.  Consequently, almost every function that works on a JuMP `Model` object will also work on a Plasmo.jl `OptiGraph` object.   

## Overview
The core object in Plasmo.jl is the `OptiGraph` wherein a user can add `OptiNodes` which represent individual optimization problems. The optinodes in an optigraph can be linked together
using `LinkConstraint`s which induces an underlying hypergraph structure. Furthermore, optigraphs be embedded within other optigraphs to induce nested hierarchical structures.
The graph structures obtained using Plasmo.jl can be used for model and data management, specialized graph partitioning, and for communicating structured problems to distributed optimization solvers (e.g. such as with [PipsNLP.jl](https://github.com/zavalab/PipsNLP.jl)).

## Documentation
The latest documentation is available through [GitHub Pages](https://zavalab.github.io/Plasmo.jl/dev/).
Additional examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/zavalab/Plasmo.jl/tree/master/examples/) folder.

## Installation

```julia
pkg> add Plasmo
```

## Simple Example

```julia
using Plasmo
using Ipopt

#create an optigraph
graph = OptiGraph()

#add nodes to an optigraph
@optinode(graph,n1)
@optinode(graph,n2)

#add variables, constraints, and objective functions to nodes
@variable(n1,0 <= x <= 2)
@variable(n1,0 <= y <= 3)
@constraint(n1,x+y <= 4)
@objective(n1,Min,x)

@variable(n2,x)
@NLconstraint(n2,exp(x) >= 2)

#add a linkconstraint to couple nodes
@linkconstraint(graph,n1[:x] == n2[:x])

#optimize with Ipopt
set_optimizer(graph,Ipopt.Optimizer)
optimize!(graph)

#Print solution values
println("n1[:x] = ",value(n1[:x]))
println("n2[:x] = ",value(n2[:x]))
```
